Job postings scraper for school_id 693 - Macalester College (US)
ATS platform: Workday (detected: workday)
Careers link: https://macalester.wd108.myworkdayjobs.com/humanresources-careers

Macalester College runs on a shared ATS platform -- every school on workday uses the
same underlying site software, so this calls the shared
job_postings_lib.scrape_workday adapter rather than duplicating
platform-specific logic here. If results for THIS ONE school need a tweak
that shouldn't apply to every workday school, define find_links() below
and pass it to run_checkpointed instead of editing the shared adapter.

Writes school_job_posts/school_id_693_job_posts.csv (school_id, post_link).
Checkpointed to school_id_693_job_postings.checkpoint next to this script.
