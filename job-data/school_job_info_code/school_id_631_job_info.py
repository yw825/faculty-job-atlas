Job info scraper for school_id 631 - University of Michigan-Ann Arbor (US)
ATS platform: own website
Careers link: https://careers.umich.edu/search-jobs

Reads posting URLs from school_id_631_job_postings.checkpoint (this
school's job_postings run) and classifies each one: job_title_in_post,
position_type, job_term, department_or_school, area_key_words,
deadline_of_application, position_start_date.


area_key_words has three parts: the subject named in the title's own rank
clause, up to 2 topics read out of the description's research sentences,
and 1 read out of its teaching sentences. Set USE_LLM = True once
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is available for a real read of those sentences instead
of the local heuristic.

Writes school_job_info/school_id_631_job_info.csv. Checkpointed to
school_id_631_job_info.checkpoint next to this script -- kill-and-resume,
per-posting granularity.
