Job info scraper for school_id 1902 - SKEMA Business School (France)
ATS platform: own website
Careers link: https://recrutement.skema.edu/?page=advertisement

No bulk info adapter applies to this school -- fetch_detail(url) below
visits each posting page individually and is THIS SCHOOL'S OWN detail-page
logic, owned entirely by this file (mirrors how find_links() works in this
school's job_postings script). Edit it directly if SKEMA Business School's posting
pages need something the default doesn't handle; nothing here affects any
other school's script.

SKEMA's adverts are plain server-rendered pages on its own PHP recruiting
board (`?page=advertisement_display&id=N`), with the title in the page
<title> and the body as ordinary visible text, so the generic detail
fetcher handles them without help.

Reads posting URLs from school_id_1902_job_postings.checkpoint (this
school's job_postings run) and classifies each one: job_title_in_post,
position_type, job_term, department_or_school, area_key_words,
deadline_of_application, position_start_date.

area_key_words has three parts: the subject named in the title's own rank
clause, up to 2 topics read out of the description's research sentences,
and 1 read out of its teaching sentences. Set USE_LLM = True once
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is available for a real read of those sentences instead
of the local heuristic.

Writes school_job_info/school_id_1902_job_info.csv. Checkpointed to
school_id_1902_job_info.checkpoint next to this script -- kill-and-resume,
per-posting granularity.
